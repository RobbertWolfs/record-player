# Record player

*Follow my log book [here](https://github.com/RobbertWolfs/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).*

## Goal

I'm making this project for the [#100daysofcode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.8qamlpr3r) challenge. 
Last year I learned a lot about AngularJs, also this year I would like to learn new JS framework. This year I would like to know more about VueJS.
When I came across the #100daysofcode challenge I was directly excited, because this was something I needed to start my journy for a new framework. 

## Description

I bought myself a new Record Player for Christmas, because I like to listing to music and really like the vintage touch about record players. So I thought it would be a nice idea to make a project about music.
I was thinking about what I could do with record players as main goal for my project, so after looking for some inspiration I came across [this site](https://tympanus.net/Development/RecordPlayer/). I thought this was a perfect project to remake.
But not just "copy" by following the tutorial but just make it all by my own without following the tutorial. I'm just gona use this website as inspiration.
